# Architecture

How the Terhal API is built to stay correct, survive failures and grow. Read this before adding a module, a job or a
migration.

## Principles

- **Correctness first.** No lost bookings, no double-sold seats, no session that outlives its rules. Postgres handles a
  single company's load easily, so the risk is in query shape and concurrency, not traffic.
- **Postgres is the source of truth.** Every invariant the database can hold is enforced there (CHECKs, unique and
  partial indexes, foreign keys, triggers such as the append-only audit log). Redis holds nothing that can't be rebuilt.
- **Assume every dependency fails.** Redis, the email provider, the network, a deploy halfway through. Each failure must
  be detected, contained and recoverable without losing data.
- **Write decisions down.** Significant decisions get a short ADR in [`docs/adr/`](adr/): the context, the decision, and
  what we gave up.

## Non-goals

| Not doing          | Why                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Microservices      | One team, one database. They'd turn function calls into network failures and take away transactions. |
| Multi-tenancy      | Terhal serves one company. Rehletak was the multi-tenant version. |
| Kubernetes         | One VPS running Docker Compose is enough until it isn't ([ADR 0001](adr/0001-one-vps.md)).        |
| A generated client | The web app is the only client and ships with the API, so Hono RPC types it ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-rpc-and-openapi.md)). |

## Layout

```
apps/
  server/       the API and the worker (Hono, BullMQ, Prisma)
  web/          Next.js: customer site, staff dashboard and admin panel, one host each (proxy.ts)
packages/
  contracts/    request and response schemas (plain zod), shared by the API and the web app
tooling/
  tsconfig/     the shared TypeScript config
  eslint/       the shared, type-aware ESLint config
infra/          local Postgres and Redis (Docker Compose)
deploy/         the VPS: one Compose stack per environment, the edge Caddy, bootstrap and deploy scripts
docs/           this file and the ADRs
```

## The server: a modular monolith

```
apps/server/src/
  modules/
    identity/       admin invitations, sign in with two-factor, sessions (staff and customers join here)
    audit/          the append-only audit log and the admin panel's view of it
    ...             fleet, trips, pricing, locations, notifications, as they're ported
  platform/         config, db, redis, crypto, email, errors, http, rate limits, logging, jobs, lifecycle
  http/             composition root: global middleware, health, mounts each module's routes under /v1
  app.ts worker.ts  process entry points
  client.ts         the route types the web app's RPC client is built from
```

- Each module has three layers:
  - `http` declares its routes (`createRoute` from `@hono/zod-openapi`), validates input against
    `@terhal/contracts` schemas and serializes output.
  - `application` holds the use cases. They own transactions.
  - `domain` holds pure functions and rules, e.g. session lifetimes. No IO, so they're tested on their own.
- Modules talk through each other's public `index.ts`, never through each other's tables or internals.
- `eslint-plugin-boundaries` enforces this in `pnpm lint` (`apps/server/eslint.config.js`):
  - another module is reachable only through its `index.ts`, and a module's own layers never import that `index.ts`;
  - `http` → `application` → `domain`, never upwards, and module `http` never touches the database;
  - `domain` imports no Prisma, Redis, BullMQ or Hono, and no platform service except errors;
  - `platform` never imports modules or `http`.
- Prisma models never leave the server. Every response is an explicit DTO, so new columns (and secrets like
  `passwordHash`) are never exposed by accident.
- Server imports are relative, never an `@/` alias: the web app type checks the server's source through RPC, and an
  alias would resolve against the web app's own `@/`.

## Contracts, OpenAPI and RPC

- `@terhal/contracts` holds every request and response schema, the error codes and the problem shape. It's plain zod
  with `.meta()`, shipped as TypeScript (the server bundles it with tsup, Next transpiles it).
- Routes are declared with `@hono/zod-openapi`, so one declaration validates the request, generates the OpenAPI
  document and types the web app's client:
  - `GET /v1/openapi.json` is the document and `GET /v1/docs` a browsable page for it (Scalar). Both are served
    everywhere except production, since they list every route.
  - `apps/server/openapi.json` is the committed copy. The contract test fails when the API changes it; after an intended
    change, regenerate it with `pnpm --filter @terhal/server test -u` and commit it with the change, so every API change
    shows up in review.
  - The web app calls the API through `hc<AppType>` (`apps/web/lib/api.ts`), e.g. `api.v1.admin.auth.session.$get()`.
    Module routers are chained (`.openapi(...).openapi(...)`) so their types carry through.
- Single resources come back as the object itself; lists as `{ data, nextCursor }`, never a bare array, so fields can be
  added later.

## Errors

- Expected failures throw `AppError` (`platform/errors/app-error.ts`) with a code from `@terhal/contracts`, a status and
  a human detail. Clients switch on `code`, never on `detail`.
- Every error response is RFC 9457 problem details (`application/problem+json`) with the request id, which is also on
  every log line written while handling it. Validation failures are `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` with one `errors` entry per
  problem.
- Anything else thrown is a bug: logged in full, answered with a generic 500. An unreachable or overloaded database is a
  503, so clients retry.

## Auth

- Each audience (customer site, staff dashboard, admin panel) has its own origin, its own session cookies and its own
  JWT secret, so a token from one can never be used as another. The API accepts each audience's routes only from its
  own origin (CORS plus an Origin check on unsafe methods), so a bug on the customer site can't act through an admin's
  session.
- Admin cookies are httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax and host-only on the API, with paths scoped so the refresh token and
  the sign in challenge only reach `/v1/admin/auth`.
- Admins sign in with a password and then a TOTP code; the access token lives 15 minutes, a session at most 12 hours,
  and every request re-checks the admin is still active.
- Everything security relevant is written to the audit log, in the same transaction as the change it records.

## Failure handling

| Concern  | Rule |
| -------- | ---- |
| Config   | `platform/config/env.ts` validates every variable at startup with zod. A missing secret or URL stops the process instead of running insecurely. |
| Timeouts | Requests get a 503 after 15 seconds. Every outbound call must have a timeout. |
| Health   | `/health/live` checks only that the process is up. `/health/ready` drives the deploy's healthcheck: it fails while shutting down or when Postgres is unreachable; Redis is reported as `degraded`. |
| Shutdown | On `SIGTERM` the API fails readiness, stops accepting connections, finishes in-flight requests, then closes Prisma and Redis, inside the container's `stop_grace_period`. The worker stops taking jobs and finishes its current ones. |
| Jobs     | Processors must be idempotent (BullMQ runs jobs at least once): give jobs deterministic ids, retry with backoff. |
| Redis down | Rate limits on sign in fail closed: an unreachable Redis must not mean unlimited password guesses. |
| Client IPs | Rate limits trust only the header named by `CLIENT_IP_HEADER`, which the edge Caddy overwrites. Never publish the server's port. |
| Neon     | `DATABASE_URL` is the pooled URL (PgBouncer, transaction mode), so no session state: no session advisory locks. Migrations use the direct URL. The API and the database must be in the same region. |
| Migrations | Expand and contract: a deploy never breaks the code that's still running. They run in their own container before the new version starts (`deploy/deploy.sh`), never at boot. |
| Rollback | Because migrations stay backward compatible, a rollback is a redeploy of the previous images (README, "Deploys"). |

## Tests

- `pnpm test` runs Vitest against real Postgres and Redis started by testcontainers (Docker required), never mocks,
  because the invariants live in the database. Each worker gets its own copy of a migrated template database and its own
  Redis database, so files run in parallel.
- Tests go through HTTP where they can (`test/support/http.ts` keeps cookies like a browser), so they exercise
  validation, auth, rate limits and serialization too.

## Adding a module

1. Schemas first: requests and responses in `packages/contracts/src/<module>.ts`, exported from its `index.ts`.
2. `apps/server/src/modules/<module>/`: `domain/` for rules, `application/` for use cases, `http/routes.ts` for routes,
   and an `index.ts` that exports only what other modules and the router need.
3. Mount its routes in `src/http/router.ts` (chained onto `v1`).
4. Regenerate the contract (`pnpm --filter @terhal/server test -u`), and add tests next to the others.
